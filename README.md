# Google Drive File Uploader - Master Branch
Anonymous file uploader for Google Drive

## Use case
An IT department is providing support for a Board Meeting, and they're asked to set up a way for participants to upload their Powerpoints ahead of time. Because these Powerpoints often contain sensitive information, the participants should not be able to access any files that other participants have uploaded.
