# Google Drive File Uploader - Master Branch
Anonymous file uploader for Google Drive

## Use case
An IT department is providing support for a board meeting, and they're asked to set up a way for participants to upload their Powerpoints to a single folder ahead of time. Because these Powerpoints can contain sensitive information, the participants should not be able to access any files that other participants have uploaded.
